        Kalamkari literally means, “pen-art”. Kalamkari paintings are either hand painted or block printed on cotton fabric. This art form flourished under the rule of the Golconda Sultanat. It was first developed and evolved at Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh but its popularity soon spread to the other states. As far as the popular belief goes, in olden days, groups of artisans, musicians and singers known as chitrakattis would travel from village to village and narrate tales of Hindu mythology. As time passed, they even started illustrating these stories on canvas and thus Kalamkari was born.
