        These paintings find their origins and derive their name from a village called ‘Madhubani’ in Bihar. These paintings were first painted by the artists hailing from this village. King Janakraj, father of Sita wanted the artists to capture moments of Sita’s wedding ceremony with Lord Ram. Hence, these paintings came to be known as ‘Mithila’ Paintings. Predominately, the themes revolve around mythology, Hindu Gods and various royal court scenarios.
